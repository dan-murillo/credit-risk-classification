### Study conclusions explained with the results of the analysis:



### How the analysis was conducted:

Standard training and testing (75% vs 25% of the data respectively)


### Improvements for future analyses:
Could stratify the model by 'healthy loans' and 'high-risk loans' to deal with the imbalance without the need to oversample the latter type of loans.
After implementing this model, it will require frequent model maintenance to verify if the model is still behaving as expected.


Contents of the repository:

### The *Credit_Risk* folder:

It contains a Jupyter Notebook with the Python code of my analysis.
