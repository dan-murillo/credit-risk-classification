# Predicting credit risk classification with Machine Learning (*Challenge 20*)

This repository contains a mini-project in a model based on loan risk was trained and evaluated in order to determine whether a customer which a 541 cities dataset was generated. The data were used to analyse the relationship between the equator and the weather as well as to determine whether latitude could predict four different weather variables.
